# simulator kept for tests so the app on your everyday one isn't replaced). Extra arguments go to xcodebuild, e.g.
#   scripts/sim-test.sh -only-testing:BitChordTests
#   scripts/sim-test.sh -only-testing:LyricsTests/LrcParserTests
# Building happens in parallel with other checkouts; the simulator run itself is
# serialised through a lock file so concurrent checkouts don't fight over the device.

# Parallel compile jobs are capped at 3 so the machine stays usable during a build (JOBS=n overrides).
